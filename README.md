This is the development project for 

# ActiveQL 

A framework for building domain driven GraphQL APIs with an oppionated approach and _convention over configuration_ and _DRY_ in mind. Based on a simple domain configuration (mainly entities with attributes and their relationships) it 

  * generates a full GraphQL schema with aspects like searching, sorting, paging, permission access etc.   
  * provides a full fledged GraphQL API with resolvers - powered by [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) (other Databases can be supported as well)
  * provides an Admin UI for basic CRUD applications 
  * allows to be extended for any non-convention requirement with custom code

You can find the [documentation here](https://betterobjects.github.io/activeql/)
